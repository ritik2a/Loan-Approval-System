This project implements a loan approval system using Support Vector Machine (SVM) machine learning algorithm, achieving an accuracy of 93.35% on the test dataset. Users can train the model using the provided dataset, test its performance, and make predictions on new loan applications. The system's effectiveness in predicting loan approvals makes it a valuable tool for financial institutions.
